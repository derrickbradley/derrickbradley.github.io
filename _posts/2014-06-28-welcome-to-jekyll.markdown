Recommendation engines have recently become a lot less interesting. Take Instagram. Prior to being acquired by Facebook they allowed users to explore trending content across its network. Now it shows me photos based on what I've liked in the past, removing the edges of its network and confining me to a subgenre of Instegram. This makes the platform a lot less interesting. I don't want to see more of what I'm following in my feed. I'd much rather be introduced to things I've never though to search for before. I have the same frustration with ad retargeting. Being shown an ad on Facebook the moment after I've left a manufacture's site is probably the least engaging thing to present users with. I'd much rather be shown a review of the product from a blog that I trust and then another -- let me explore the network. Rarely do people go from site --> purchase.

same with facebook's advertising model, simple
